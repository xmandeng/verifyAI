# Overall Assessment



**This is a poorly performing premises general liability book (EULR > 0.7). The underwriting is geographically diversified with underwriting in NY producing the lowest loss ratios. Pricing has improved in the most recent underwriting years and lower (albeit > 0.7) loss ratios are expected for these treaty years.**

## False

The insight is generally accurate in its assessment of the premises general liability book, with 4 out of 5 claims verified as true. However, one critical claim is false: "Underwriting in NY producing the lowest loss ratios." Evidence shows that NY does not consistently have the lowest loss ratios across all years, with other regions showing lower ratios in certain periods. While the insight correctly identifies the poor performance (EULR > 0.7), geographic diversification, improved pricing in recent years, and the expectation of lower but still elevated loss ratios, this factual error regarding NY's performance makes the overall insight invalid. No grammatical errors were identified in the insight.



## Conclusion

**"This is a poorly performing premises general liability book.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. The Expected Ultimate Loss Ratio (EULR) is greater than 0.7.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS Data table at the top of the image shows loss ratios (labeled as 'lr') for underwriting years 2019-2024. The values are 1.08, 1.21, 1.32, 1.02, 0.97, and 0.92 respectively. All of these values are greater than 0.7, confirming that the Expected Ultimate Loss Ratio is indeed greater than 0.7 for all underwriting years shown.

**2. The underwriting is geographically diversified.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The bottom chart (cad1.png) clearly shows data broken down by geographical regions including Other, NY, Eastern States, LA, and FL. This indicates the insurance portfolio is underwritten across multiple geographic locations, demonstrating geographic diversification in the underwriting portfolio.

**3. Underwriting in NY is producing the lowest loss ratios.**

**Status** <br>False [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>According to the cad1.png chart at the bottom of the image, which shows loss ratios by geographic region, NY does not consistently show the lowest loss ratios across all years. While NY appears to have relatively lower loss ratios in some years, other regions like 'Other' appear to have lower loss ratios in certain years. The data points for NY are not consistently at the bottom of the chart compared to other regions.

**4. Pricing has improved in the most recent underwriting years.**

**Status** <br>True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS Data table shows that the values in the 'lr' column (loss ratios) have been decreasing in more recent years: from 1.32 in 2021 to 1.02 in 2022, then 0.97 in 2023, and 0.92 in 2024. This downward trend in loss ratios indicates improving pricing adequacy in recent underwriting years. Additionally, the 'p' column (which likely represents pricing metrics) shows values decreasing from 1.21 in 2020 to 0.09 in 2024, which could indicate pricing adjustments.

**5. Lower loss ratios are expected for these treaty years, although they are still greater than 0.7.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS Data table confirms that loss ratios are trending downward in recent years (from 1.32 in 2021 to 0.92 in 2024), indicating lower loss ratios are expected. And as noted, all of the loss ratio values shown in the table remain above 0.7, with the lowest being 0.92 for 2024. This supports the claim that while loss ratios are expected to be lower, they still remain above 0.7.
