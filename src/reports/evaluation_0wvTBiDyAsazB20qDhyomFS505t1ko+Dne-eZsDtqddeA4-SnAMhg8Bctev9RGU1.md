# Overall Assessment



**The book is long-tailed and profitable. The first underwriting year has produced worse than predicted results but the following years appear to be performing better on both severity and frequency of claims. Performance is driven by some relatively severe losses and the projections have high variance. Pricing has strengthen every treaty year which is consistent with improved LR.**

## True

The insight is generally valid with strong supporting evidence for most claims. The majority of claims (3 out of 6) were deemed fully true with high or medium confidence, while 3 claims were assessed as partially true. The main factual premises regarding treaty performance trends, severity of losses, and pricing strengthening are all supported by the data. Minor weaknesses include: 1) lack of explicit benchmarks for "predicted results" in the first year, 2) no clear visualization of projection variance, and 3) limited direct evidence for improved loss ratios. There is one grammatical error identified (incorrect verb tense of "strengthen"). Overall, despite these minor issues, the insight accurately captures the key trends in the insurance program's performance and provides a valid analysis of the book's profitability and evolution over treaty years.



## Conclusion

**"The book is long-tailed and profitable.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. The first underwriting year has produced worse than predicted results.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The image shows that Treaty 1 (which appears to be the first underwriting year) has higher severity and frequency of claims compared to subsequent years (shown in yellow lines in both severity and frequency charts). However, there is no explicit 'predicted results' benchmark shown in the data to directly compare against. The LRS Data section shows values for 2021 with 0.44 p* and 0.79 uf, but without context on whether these values are better or worse than predictions.

**2. The following years appear to be performing better on both severity and frequency of claims.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The severity and frequency charts clearly show that Treaty 2 (green line) and Treaty 3 (blue line) have lower values compared to Treaty 1 (yellow line). In the severity chart, the yellow line (Treaty 1) shows higher severity of claims than green (Treaty 2) and blue (Treaty 3) lines. Similarly, in the frequency chart, the yellow line (Treaty 1) shows higher frequency of claims than the green and blue lines. This consistently indicates better performance in later treaty years.

**3. Performance is driven by some relatively severe losses.**

**Status** <br>True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The severity chart shows significant jumps in the yellow line (Treaty 1), indicating some relatively severe losses driving overall performance. The bottom graphs (cud.png and curf.png) also show some higher loss ratios for certain categories, particularly for Treaty 1 (orange markers), with some points reaching above 1.0, indicating losses exceeding premiums. These relatively severe losses appear to be influencing the overall performance metrics.

**4. The projections have high variance.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Low confidence]

**Rationale** <br>While there is visible variance in the data points shown in the lower graphs with scattered data points at different heights, there are no explicit projection lines or confidence intervals shown in the charts that would indicate the variance of projections specifically. The severity and frequency charts do show fluctuations over time, particularly in Treaty 1, which could suggest variance in outcomes, but without explicit projection bands or variance indicators, this claim can only be partially supported.

**5. Pricing has strengthened every treaty year.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The pricing.png chart labeled 'Written Premium per Risk and Days Covered' shows a clear upward trend across the four treaty years (marked by vertical red lines). The premium rates start lower in Treaty 1, then gradually increase through Treaties 2, 3, and 4, with each subsequent treaty generally showing higher premium levels than the previous one. This indicates that pricing has indeed strengthened (increased) with each treaty year.

**6. This is consistent with improved LR.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>If LR refers to Loss Ratio, the combination of increasing pricing (shown in the pricing chart) and decreasing severity and frequency of claims in later treaty years (shown in the severity and frequency charts) would logically result in improved (lower) loss ratios. The lower charts (cud.png and curf.png) appear to show loss ratios, with Treaty 1 (orange) generally having higher values than later treaties. However, there's no comprehensive loss ratio trend chart explicitly showing improved LR across all treaty years, making this partially supported by the available data.



## Grammar

- 'strengthen' should be 'strengthened' (incorrect verb tense)
