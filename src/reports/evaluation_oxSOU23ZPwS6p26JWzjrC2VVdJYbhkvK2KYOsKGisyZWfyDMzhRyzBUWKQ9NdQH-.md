# Overall Assessment



**The book is long-tailed and profitable. The first underwriting year has produced worse than predicted results but the following years appear to be performing better on both severity and frequency of claims. Performance is driven by some relatively severe losses and the projections have high variance. Pricing has strengthen every treaty year which is consistent with improved LR.**

## True

The insight is largely valid with four main claims, three of which are fully supported by the evidence and one that is partially supported. The claim about the book being long-tailed and profitable is partially true as there is strong evidence for the long-tailed nature but only partial evidence for overall profitability (with positive indicators for 2021-2023 but incomplete data for 2024). The claims about first year underperformance, performance being driven by severe losses, and pricing strengthening each treaty year (despite the grammatical error) are all fully supported by the data with medium to high confidence. While there is one grammatical error ("strengthen" should be "strengthened"), this does not impact the factual validity of the analysis.



## Conclusion

**"The following years appear to be performing better on both severity and frequency of claims.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. The book is long-tailed and profitable.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The image provides evidence that the book is long-tailed based on the severity and frequency charts that show claim development over time (up to 1200 days). The LRS Data table shows loss ratios below 1.0 for years 2021-2023 (0.44, 0.18, 0.07), indicating profitability for those years. However, there's no comprehensive data on overall profitability considering all factors such as expenses, and the 2024 data shows '0.0' for 'lr' which is incomplete information.

**2. The first underwriting year has produced worse than predicted results.**

**Status** <br>True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS Data table shows the first underwriting year (2021) with a loss ratio of 0.44, which is significantly higher than subsequent years (0.18 in 2022 and 0.07 in 2023). This indicates the first year performed worse than later years. Additionally, both the claim severity and claim frequency charts show higher development patterns for the earliest period (marked as '1' in the charts), supporting that the first underwriting year produced worse results.

**3. Performance is driven by some relatively severe losses.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The 'Claim Severity' chart in the severity.png section clearly shows some relatively high severity losses, particularly for the first treaty year (yellow line) which shows severity ratios reaching above 0.12. The bottom charts also indicate that certain states (like TX and NY) and certain years (particularly year 1) have much higher loss ratios than others, suggesting that performance is indeed influenced by some relatively severe losses.

**4. Pricing has strengthened every treaty year which is consistent with improved LR.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The 'Written Premium per Risk and Days Covered' chart (pricing.png) shows a generally increasing trend across treaty years 1-4, indicating strengthening pricing. This aligns with the improving loss ratios shown in the LRS Data table, where the loss ratio improved from 0.44 in 2021 to 0.18 in 2022 and further to 0.07 in 2023. The vertical treaty year lines in the pricing chart correspond with visible increases in the premium trend, supporting the claim that pricing has strengthened with each treaty year, consistent with the improving loss ratios.



## Grammar

- 'strengthen' should be 'strengthened' since it's being used in past tense
