# Overall Assessment



**This is a NSA program with EULR < 0.7. The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states. There is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

## True

The insight is generally valid with high confidence in the claim about Florida having higher loss ratios than other states, as clearly supported by the data showing FL with approximately 0.30 loss ratio compared to NY and "Other" states at approximately 0.15-0.20. The second claim about a "considerable increase in price in the most recent months" is partially true - while there is an identifiable increase in the premium line toward the end of the time period (2024-06 to 2024-08), the characterization as "considerable" somewhat overstates the actual magnitude of this increase, which appears modest in the data. No grammatical errors were identified in the insight. The insight correctly identifies this as an NSA program with EULR < 0.7, which was not challenged in the evaluation.



## Conclusion

**"The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The bottom right chart labeled 'nvr1.png' clearly shows loss ratios by state. FL (Florida) has a loss ratio of approximately 0.30, which is higher than NY (approximately 0.15-0.20) and 'Other' states (approximately 0.15). FL's loss ratio appears to be the second highest among the states shown, with only AZ showing a higher loss ratio. The data supports that Florida has higher loss ratios than most other states depicted in the chart.

**2. There is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The top right chart labeled 'pricing.png' shows 'Written Premium per Risk and Days Covered' over time. There is a slight upward trend in the premium line toward the end of the time period shown (around 2024-06 to 2024-08), but this increase appears modest rather than 'considerable.' The premium line does show an uptick in the most recent months, but the magnitude of this increase is relatively small compared to the overall premium levels shown throughout the chart. Therefore, while there is an increase in recent months, describing it as 'considerable' overstates the magnitude of the change shown in the data.
