# Overall Assessment



**This is a historically poor performing commercial auto book with a focus on LOB 19.4. Pricing and underwriting has improved in the past two treaty years which we expect will translate to slightly better LRs.**

## True

The insurance insight is generally valid based on the evidence provided. The claim about historically poor performance is supported by high loss ratio data (0.88 in 2021). The statement about pricing improvements is partially true as there are some improvements visible but with significant fluctuations. The claim about improved underwriting is strongly supported by the dramatic decrease in loss ratios from 0.88 in 2021 to 0.13 in 2023. The expectation of "slightly better LRs" is somewhat understated given the substantial improvements already achieved, but the directional claim is accurate. No grammatical errors were identified. While there are some nuances in how the improvements are characterized, the overall insight provides a reasonably accurate assessment of the commercial auto book's performance and trajectory.



## Conclusion

**"This is a historically poor performing commercial auto book.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. This is a historically poor performing commercial auto book.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS (Loss Ratio) data at the top of the image shows consistently high loss ratios: 0.88 in 2021, 0.38 in 2022, and 0.13 in 2023. Insurance loss ratios above 0.7 are generally considered poor in commercial lines. While there's improvement over time, the 2021 figure of 0.88 indicates a historically poor performing book of business as it means claims paid were 88% of premiums collected, leaving very little for expenses and profit.

**2. Pricing has improved in the past two treaty years.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The pricing.png chart shows 'Written Premium per Risk and Days Covered' with vertical lines marking 2021, 2022, and 2023. There appears to be some upward movement in pricing in the more recent periods, particularly after the 2022 marker. However, the chart shows significant fluctuations, making it difficult to conclusively state that pricing has consistently improved. The trend shows some general improvement but with considerable volatility rather than a clear, sustained increase.

**3. Underwriting has improved in the past two treaty years.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS data shows significant improvement in loss ratios: from 0.88 in 2021 to 0.38 in 2022 and further down to 0.13 in 2023. This dramatic decrease in loss ratios strongly suggests improved underwriting performance, as lower loss ratios typically indicate better risk selection and underwriting practices. Additionally, the charts for claim severity and frequency show more controlled patterns in more recent periods, further supporting improved underwriting practices.

**4. We expect improvements will translate to slightly better LRs.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The data already shows dramatically improved LRs (Loss Ratios), which decreased from 0.88 in 2021 to 0.13 in 2023. The statement suggests an expectation of 'slightly better LRs' in the future, but the improvement has already been substantial rather than slight. While the trend supports the general direction of the claim (improvement in LRs), the characterization of 'slightly' better is understated compared to the actual significant improvements already observed. Without forward-looking projections in the image, the future expectation aspect can only be partially validated based on the established trend.
