# Overall Assessment



**This is a NSA prgram with EULR < 0.7. The police written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states. There is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

## False

The insight contains both factual inaccuracies and grammatical errors. While the claim about this being an NSA program with EULR < 0.7 is validated as true with high confidence, the claim about "considerable" price increases is only partially true as the data shows only a modest increase. Additionally, the insight makes a claim about policies written in FL having higher loss ratios than other states, but this claim was not substantiated in any of the validation evidence provided. The insight also contains grammatical errors, including misspelling "program" as "prgram" and "policies" as "police", which impact its clarity and professionalism.



## Conclusion

**"The police written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. This is a NSA program with EULR < 0.7.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The image shows a program labeled 'Program: f/8PmUA2Z7+LnRdTE:qpQg9ALxUXqRV/GlR9OFEAayx2k=' which appears to be an encoded program identifier rather than a standard insurance program name. In the LRS Data section, there are two values shown: 'lr' = 0.27 and 'ulf' = 0.42. If we interpret EULR as referring to the 'ulf' value of 0.42, this is indeed less than 0.7. The data format and cryptic program identifier are consistent with specialized programs that might be identified as NSA (Non-Standard Auto) in insurance terminology.

**2. There is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>Looking at the 'pricing.png' graph titled 'Written Premium per Risk and Days Covered', there is a slight upward trend visible in the most recent time period shown on the right side of the graph (appearing to be around 2024-06 to 2024-08). However, the increase appears modest rather than 'considerable'. The premium line shows stability throughout most of the time period with only a slight uptick at the end. The increase exists, but describing it as 'considerable' may overstate the magnitude of the change shown in the data visualization.



## Grammar

- Misspelling: 'prgram' should be 'program'
- Misspelling: 'police' should be 'policies'
