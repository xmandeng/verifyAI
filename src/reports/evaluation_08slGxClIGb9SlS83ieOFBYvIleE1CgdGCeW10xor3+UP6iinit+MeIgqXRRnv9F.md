# Overall Assessment

---

**This is a well-performing trucking program (EULR < 0.7) consisting predominantly of auto liability risk (LOB 19.4, 21.2). Performance is consistent or improving by underwriting cohorts due to a reduction in frequency. Risk is entirely concentrated in CA.**

## True

The insight is considered valid overall. The evidence strongly supports the claim about EULR being less than 0.7 with high confidence, as confirmed by the LRS Data table showing values of 0.61 and 0.57 across years. The claim about performance consistency or improvement is partially true with medium confidence - while there is evidence of improvement in the 2024 cohort and general improvement in loss ratio, some inconsistency exists between 2023 cohorts. No evaluation was provided for the claims about auto liability risk (LOB 19.4, 21.2) or risk concentration in CA, but no contradictory evidence was presented either. No grammatical errors were identified in the insight. Based on the available evidence and validations, the insight appears to be factually sound overall.

## Conclusion

**"This is a well-performing trucking program.**"

## Supporting Evidence

**1. The Expected Ultimate Loss Ratio (EULR) is less than 0.7.**

**Status** <br>True [High confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The LRS Data table at the top of the image clearly shows the 'uf' (which appears to be the Ultimate Loss Ratio) values for three years: 2023 (0.61), 2023 (0.61), and 2024 (0.57). All of these values are below 0.7, confirming that the EULR is indeed less than 0.7 across all years shown.

**2. Performance is consistent or improving by underwriting cohorts due to a reduction in frequency.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The frequency chart (labeled 'frequency.png') shows claim frequency per policy across different cohorts (2024, 2023A, 2023B). The 2024 cohort (blue line) appears to have lower frequency than the 2023 cohorts. However, the 2023A (green) has higher frequency than 2023B (yellow), indicating some inconsistency. The loss ratio also improves from 0.61 in 2023 to 0.57 in 2024, suggesting better performance. While there is some evidence of improvement in the 2024 cohort and a general improvement in the loss ratio, the inconsistency between 2023 cohorts means the statement is only partially supported.
