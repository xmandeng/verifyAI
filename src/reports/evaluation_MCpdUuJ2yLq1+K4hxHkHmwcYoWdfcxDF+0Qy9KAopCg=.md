# Overall Assessment



**This is a NSA program with EULR < 0.7. The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states. Premium growth has slowed in H2 2024. Finally, there is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

## False

The insight contains multiple factual claims that are not fully supported by the evidence:

1. While the claim about FL having higher loss ratios than other states is TRUE (with medium confidence), the evidence shows it's higher than some states but not all.

2. The claim about premium growth slowing in H2 2024 is FALSE as the data only extends to mid-2024, making it impossible to evaluate H2 2024 performance.

3. The claim about a "considerable increase in price" is only PARTIALLY TRUE, as the data shows only a modest increase rather than a considerable one.

Additionally, while the insight mentions this is an "NSA program with EULR < 0.7," this claim wasn't evaluated in the supporting evidence, so its validity cannot be confirmed.

Due to these inaccuracies, particularly the completely false claim about H2 2024 which represents future data not yet available, the overall insight cannot be considered valid.



## Conclusion

**"The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states.**"



## Supporting Evidence

**1. The policies written in FL appear to have higher loss ratios than other states.**

**Status** <br>True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>In the bottom right chart (cur1.png) showing loss ratios by state, Florida (FL) appears to have one of the higher loss ratios compared to other states shown (NY, CO, AZ, Other). Florida's loss ratio appears to be around 0.25-0.30, which is higher than NY and 'Other' states, though appears comparable to CO and slightly lower than AZ. The data supports that FL has higher loss ratios than some other states, though not necessarily the highest overall.

**2. Premium growth has slowed in H2 2024.**

**Status** <br>False [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>The image only shows data for 2024 through what appears to be early-to-mid 2024. In the top right chart (pricing.png) showing written premium per risk and days covered, there is no data visible for H2 (second half) of 2024, as the chart appears to only show data through approximately mid-2024. There is no way to evaluate premium growth for H2 2024 since that data is not present in the image. In fact, the premium line shown appears to be slightly increasing in the most recent period displayed.

**3. There is a considerable increase in price in the most recent months.**

**Status** <br>Partially True [Medium confidence]

**Rationale** <br>In the top right chart (pricing.png) showing written premium per risk and days covered, there is a slight upward trend visible in the most recent time period shown. However, the increase appears to be modest rather than 'considerable'. The premium line shows a gradual upward trajectory toward the right side of the chart, but the magnitude of the increase appears relatively small compared to the overall range of the chart. While there is an increase, describing it as 'considerable' overstates the magnitude shown in the data.
